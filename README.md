# Simple Perceptron Demo

A [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) is very simple linear classification algorithm that can decide between two classes.
This demo, written entirely in HTML/JavaScript, provides a visual example to how the perceptron works
by classifying dots as either blue or red.

This demo is contained entirely in a single file for convenience, but the JS/CSS parts can easily be moved to separate files for new projects.
Instructions for using the perceptron will be rendered on the web browser along with the demo.
